## DripShipper Introduction

Let me tell you what DripShipper actually is. It's this dropshipping platform that specializes exclusively in coffee and tea products. Think of it as your behind-the-scenes partner who does all the heavy lifting.

Here's the deal: DripShipper lets you create your own private label coffee brand. You design the packaging with your logo, pick from over 40 different coffee varieties (single origins, blends, flavored coffees, coffee pods, teas—the works), and sell them through your online store. When someone orders from you, DripShipper roasts the coffee fresh, slaps your branding on it, and ships it directly to your customer within 3-5 business days. Your customers think it came from you, not some middleman.

The platform integrates seamlessly with Shopify, WooCommerce, Wix, and BigCommerce. Everything's automated—when an order comes through your store marked as "paid," DripShipper automatically processes it, handles fulfillment, and updates the tracking information. You literally just sit back and let the system work.

What makes them different? They use a roast-to-order model. The coffee isn't sitting around getting stale—it's roasted the same day it ships, sometimes even within hours of the order. For coffee lovers who care about freshness (which, let's be honest, is most of them), that's a pretty big selling point.

The quality is solid too. DripShipper sources specialty-grade beans from various regions worldwide, and their roasting facilities are FDA-compliant with certifications like Fair Trade, SHG, and SHB. They handle fulfillment from facilities in the USA, with some European fulfillment options as well.

## DripShipper Promo Codes

Alright, let's talk money-saving. Here are the current promo codes and deals available for DripShipper in 2026:

**SAVE100** - This is the big one. Use this code to get $100 off the annual plan. This is particularly useful if you're going for their turnkey store setup service, which costs $500 per year. With this code, you're looking at $400 instead.

**14-Day Free Trial** - Not exactly a promo code, but it's worth mentioning. Every subscription plan comes with a 14-day free trial. You can test the waters, order samples, and see if the coffee quality meets your standards before committing. Just remember to cancel within those 14 days if you're not feeling it, otherwise you'll be billed.

The trial is genuinely useful—you can use their demo store at dogstreetroastingco.com to order samples and taste-test the products yourself. That way you know exactly what you're selling before you start marketing it to customers.

One thing to note: these promo codes work best on annual plans rather than monthly subscriptions. The savings are more substantial when you commit for a year, but that makes sense if you're serious about building a coffee brand rather than just dipping your toes.

### Product Pricing Structure

Here's what you need to know about the actual cost of goods:

- All pricing includes free shipping to USA customers
- Pricing varies based on coffee type (single origin, blend, flavored) and bag size
- All products come with your custom branding
- No minimum order quantities—you can start with a single order
- Coffee is roasted fresh and ships within 3-5 business days

The way it works financially: You set your own retail prices on your store. When a customer orders, you collect their payment through Shopify (or whatever platform you use). DripShipper then charges your card on file for the wholesale cost of the product plus fulfillment. The difference is your profit margin.

Most successful DripShipper merchants aim for a 40-60% profit margin on their coffee products. For example, if a 12oz bag costs you $8 wholesale from DripShipper, you might sell it for $16-20 retail. The exact margins depend on your market positioning and customer base.

### Coffee Catalog

DripShipper offers over 40 different coffee and tea options you can private label:

**Coffee Types:**
- Single origin coffees from various regions (Ethiopia, Colombia, Guatemala, etc.)
- House blends and specialty roasts
- Flavored coffees (vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, seasonal flavors)
- Coffee pods compatible with major brewing systems
- Sample packs and variety bundles
- Different roast levels: light, medium, dark

**Tea Options:**
- Black teas
- Green teas
- Herbal teas
- Specialty blends

**Packaging Options:**
- Multiple bag sizes (typically 8oz, 12oz, 16oz)
- Various packaging colors and styles

## DripShipper Reviews

Let's get real about what actual users are saying. DripShipper has a 4.2 out of 5 rating based on 219 reviews on Shopify, and around 4.5/5 from over 1,860 customers across various platforms. That's pretty solid, but like anything, there are both happy campers and frustrated folks.

### The Good Stuff

People rave about the coffee quality. Multiple users mention that the roast-to-order model really does make a difference—the coffee tastes fresh, and customers notice. One user said, "Dripshipper has the absolute freshest coffee with the most varieties on the internet and their roast to order process makes every bag taste like heaven."

The Shopify integration gets consistent praise. It's genuinely automated—orders sync automatically, tracking updates populate, and the whole process just works without much manual intervention. As one merchant put it, "It is a seamless movement from Shopify to Dripshipper. So far a pleasant and professional experience."

The custom branding is another winner. People appreciate that the packaging looks professional and doesn't scream "dropshipped." Customers receive products with your logo and brand identity, which helps build legitimacy. One reviewer mentioned, "The app is easy to use. I had no difficulties with adding my logo for the custom packaging."

Customer support gets mixed-to-positive reviews. When they're on point, they're really helpful. One user specifically called out their web design team member Tayyab, saying he "completely transformed my Shopify store into a modern, professional, and eye-catching site that truly stands out."

### The Not-So-Great Stuff

The main complaints center around a few areas:

**Fulfillment issues:** Some users report orders falling through the cracks, particularly during busy periods or holidays. One merchant described a frustrating experience where an order didn't appear in the DripShipper app, and support initially asked them to recreate the order themselves rather than fixing it internally.

**Profit margins:** Multiple reviewers mention that pricing can be tight. While the quality is there, the wholesale costs mean you need to work harder on marketing and positioning to maintain healthy margins. One review simply stated, "good service and idea for coffee dropshipping, however the high pricing makes it uncompetitive in the market."

**Limited product control:** Since you're relying on DripShipper's sourcing and roasting, you don't have control over the actual product quality beyond choosing which coffees to offer. If their quality slips, you're the one hearing about it from your customers.

**Communication challenges:** A few users mention that when issues arise, the communication isn't always smooth. You're essentially the middleman between DripShipper and your customer, which can get awkward when things go wrong.

### The Verdict

For beginners who want to test the coffee dropshipping waters without massive upfront investment, DripShipper is solid. The platform genuinely does lower the barrier to entry—you don't need $100,000 to start a roasting facility, and you don't need employees to handle fulfillment.

The roast-to-order model is legit and does provide a competitive advantage in terms of freshness. The automation works well enough that you can focus on marketing and branding rather than logistics.

However, it's not a passive income goldmine. You still need to drive traffic, build a brand, and differentiate yourself in a crowded market. The dependency on a single supplier is real—if DripShipper has issues, your business has issues.

Bottom line: DripShipper is a legitimate platform that works best for entrepreneurs who understand they're building a brand, not just slapping a logo on someone else's product and hoping for sales. Put in the marketing effort, price intelligently, and provide good customer service, and it can work.

## Getting Started Tips

If you're considering DripShipper, here's what I'd recommend:

1. **Use the free trial intelligently.** Order samples through their demo store. Taste the coffee yourself. Share it with potential customers or friends who drink coffee daily. Get honest feedback before you commit.

2. **Start with the Starter plan.** Unless you already have an established e-commerce presence and need the coaching, the $30/month tier gives you everything you need to test the market. You can always upgrade later.

3. **Consider the turnkey store if you're not technical.** That $500 (or $400 with code SAVE100) might seem steep, but having a professional store built in 24 hours can save weeks of fumbling with Shopify yourself. Several reviews specifically mention this service being worth it.

4. **Focus on a niche.** Don't try to be everything to everyone. Are you targeting busy professionals who want office coffee? Fitness enthusiasts who want low-acid options? Gift buyers looking for premium options? Pick a lane and own it.

5. **The coffee quality is good, but the business success is on you.** DripShipper handles the product side. You need to handle the "getting people to actually buy from you" side. Budget for marketing, learn some basics about Facebook ads or Instagram, and be prepared to grind (no pun intended) on the business development side.

That's the real story with DripShipper. It's a tool that works, but like any tool, the results depend on how you use it.
